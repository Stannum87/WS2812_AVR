# WS2812_AVR
 program used for driving WS2812 leds, this program allows for setting RGB values for all leds(not individually) 

-> if you want to test the code for single led, use "WS2812 GRB led with individualy controllable R, G, B for multiple leds @20MHz, Switch between R,G,B.cpp" file

set RGB values there.

-> if you want to color cycle through all posssible colors(almost) use the other file

Consolidated Library Comming Soon.
